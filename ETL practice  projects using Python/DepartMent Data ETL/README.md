# Working with SQLite Databases in Python
This script demonstrates how to use SQLite3 and Pandas to manage a Departments table in an SQLite database. It loads data from a Departments.csv file into the database, performs basic SQL queries such as selecting all rows, displaying specific columns, counting the total number of rows, and appending new department records. The script highlights essential database operations like table creation, data insertion, and querying in a simple and efficient manner, useful for managing departmental data in a small-to-medium-sized database.
