# ETL Pipeline: Extract, Transform, and Load Data
This Python script implements an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for processing data from multiple file formats (CSV, JSON, and XML). It extracts data, transforms it into a standardized format, and loads the results into a CSV file. Additionally, it logs the progress of the ETL process in a log file.
