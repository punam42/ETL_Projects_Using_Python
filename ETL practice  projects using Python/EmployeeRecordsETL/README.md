# Working with SQLite Databases in Python
This script demonstrates how to use Pythonâ€™s SQLite3 and Pandas libraries to manage and manipulate data stored in a SQLite database. The script loads data from a CSV file into an SQLite database, performs basic SQL queries (such as selecting columns, counting rows), and appends new records to the table. It showcases the process of creating tables, querying data, and automating data management tasks in a simple, efficient manner, making it an ideal solution for handling small-to-medium datasets in Python.
