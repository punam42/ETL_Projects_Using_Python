# ETL Projects Overview Using Python
This project implements an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that extracts data from multiple sources, transforms it into a desired format, and loads it into a target system like a database or data warehouse. The pipeline automates data integration and preprocessing tasks for analytics or business intelligence.

# Steps:

- Extract: Collect data from APIs, databases, or files.
- Transform: Clean and format data to meet requirements.
- Load: Store the processed data in a target system for analysis.
